# Bee-project
The Bee experiment conducted at the University of Konstanz in Collaboration with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavioor. The project was led by Prof. Dr. Micheal Smith. 

Data analysis shown here was done as part of my work with Dr. Jitesh Jhawar.

This is data recorded from a bee hive in the summer of 2019. There are a total ~10 000 bees recorded throughout 115 days, about 3000 bees are present in any day. The bees have barcodes on their backs and the camera records at 3 frames per second. As a result we have a huge database of information about the bees location and movement within the hive.
