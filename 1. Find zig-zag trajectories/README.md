# The zig-zag findings.
This code finds the time and place where zig-zag patterns arise in the bee trajectory due to stitching of video recordings. 
This is done so that these trajectories are not taken into account during data analysis.

Since the data is not public, I cannot run the codes here, therefore I have added picture of data analysis.
