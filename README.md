# Bee-project
The Bee experiment conducted at the University of Konstanz in Collaboration with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. The project was led by Prof. Dr. Micheal Smith, currently leader of the Smith bee lab at Auburn University. 

Data analysis shown here was done as part of my work with Dr. Jitesh Jhawar at the   University of Konstanz.

This is data recorded from a bee hive in the summer of 2019. There are a total ~10 000 bees recorded throughout 115 days, about 3000 bees are present in any day. The bees have barcodes on their backs and the camera records at 3 frames per second. As a result we have a huge database of information about the bees location and movement within the hive. 

My data analysis shows that the bees are correlated in their movement patterns. I look at the mean during 1 minute 90th percentile of speed of movement, and find that its correlated in time more than in an equivalent dataset in which time is shuffled. 

In the first directory, I find zig-zag patterns in trajectories, which which were not known before, that are caused by the preprocessing of the data. 
In the second directory, I remove those data from the main analysis and calculate the correlation of different parameters. 

More information can be found on the directories.
